 
## **What is GPT?**  
GPT (**Generative Pre-trained Transformer**) is a deep learning model developed by **OpenAI** for **natural language processing (NLP)** tasks. It is based on the **Transformer architecture** and is designed to **generate human-like text** by predicting the next word in a sequence.

**Key Features of GPT:**  
- Uses **self-attention** to understand context.  
- Pre-trained on **massive datasets** of text (books, articles, websites).  
- Can be fine-tuned for tasks like **chatbots, summarization, and translation**.  
- Generates **coherent and creative** text responses.
